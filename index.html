    <h3 style="font-size: 2.5em; line-height: 1.2em;">The traditional cryptocurrency roadmap is not a good fit for what XP is doing because it is not a linear path. We are executing many things at the same time that go in different directions to accomplish the same thing. So to keep with gamming, we have an "Item menu" like a classic RPG.</h3>
